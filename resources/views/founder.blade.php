        <h4>Daddy Ollie, Founding Father of Our Beloved Gym</h4>
        <p>The “King”, the “Goat”, the “Muscles from Brussels”, Ollie Tennyson was a little dog who managed to make a big difference in the lives of his family, his friends, and people all over the world. Teaming up with his brother, Will, the pair built a YouTube channel with the goal of making people laugh while having fun with their fitness journeys. Ollie’s powerful presence helped to transform the channel into a community filled with overwhelming positivity and encouragement. Whether he was wearing silly costumes, chowing down on Timbits, or giving Will some serious attitude, Ollie was destined for the spotlight. If there was one thing Ollie would wake up from a nap for, it would be to get in front of the camera and entertain.</p>
